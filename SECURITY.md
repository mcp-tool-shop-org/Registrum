| < 1.0   | No        |

## Scope

Registrum is a **structural registrar library**. It validates state transitions against invariants and maintains deterministic, replayable history.

- **Data touched:** In-memory state transitions, optional JSON snapshots to local filesystem
- **Data NOT touched:** No network requests, no external APIs, no databases, no user credentials
- **Permissions:** Read/write only to user-specified snapshot paths (when persistence is used)
- **Network:** None — fully offline library
- **Telemetry:** None collected or sent
- **Code execution:** None — validates data structures only, never executes user code

The optional external attestation feature (XRPL) is disabled by default and requires explicit configuration.
