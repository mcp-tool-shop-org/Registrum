# Registrum

## Mission Statement

Registrum is a structural registrar for maintaining legibility in evolving systems.

It records, validates, and orders state transitions under explicit constraints so that structure remains interpretable as entropy accumulates. Registrum does not optimize, recommend, or decide meaning. It preserves the conditions under which meaning can be examined.

**Registrum ensures that change remains legible.**

## What Registrum Is (and Is Not)

**Registrum is:**

- A registrar, not an engine
- Constraint-based, not goal-driven
- Deterministic, not adaptive
- Structural, not semantic
- Constitutional, not executive

It operates like:

- A type system for evolving state
- A ledger for structural integrity
- A schema authority for time-varying systems

**Registrum is not:**

- An optimizer
- An agent
- A controller
- A recommender
- A decision-maker
- An intelligence

It never answers *what matters*.
It only preserves the conditions under which that question remains answerable.

---

## Non-Goals (Explicit)

Registrum will never:

- Optimize outcomes
- Rank states as better or worse
- Recommend actions
- Adapt behavior based on success or failure
- Infer intent or meaning
- Collapse multiple signals into a scalar score

---

## Core Principle

**Entropy is allowed. Illegibility is not.**

Registrum does not reduce entropy globally.
It constrains where entropy may exist so that identity, lineage, and structure remain inspectable over time.

---

## Conceptual Architecture

Registrum is built around a single constitutional component:

### Structural Registrar

The Registrar:

- Validates all state transitions
- Enforces explicit invariants
- Guarantees determinism and traceability
- Surfaces violations without resolving them

Everything else registers through it.

### Supporting Subsystems (non-agentic)

- **Identity Lattice** — Deterministic identity and content-addressable references
- **Lineage Graph** — Traceable parent-child relationships and provenance
- **Temporal Attenuation Layer** — Explicit decay and persistence rules
- **Representation Plane** — High-dimensional, bounded representations with explicit axes
- **Neighborhood Index** — Metric-grounded similarity and locality
- **Context Frames** — Scoped interpretation boundaries to prevent semantic bleed

None of these subsystems act independently.
All transitions are registered, validated, and ordered.

## Why Registrum Exists

Modern systems change faster than our ability to understand them.

- Logs accumulate without structure
- States evolve without lineage
- Models change without visibility
- Meaning drifts silently

Registrum exists to ensure that change does not outrun comprehension.

It does not make systems better.
It makes them inspectable.

---

## Design Ethos

- Restraint over power
- Legibility over performance
- Constraints over heuristics
- Inspection over intervention
- Stopping over endless extension

Registrum is successful when it becomes boring, dependable, and unsurprising.

---

## One-Sentence Summary

Registrum is a structural registrar that preserves interpretability as systems evolve, ensuring that change remains legible under entropy.
