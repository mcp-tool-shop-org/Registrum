# Scientific Position

This document states—unambiguously—what kind of scientific object Registrum is.

---

## What Registrum Claims

Registrum claims to:

1. **Maintain legibility under entropy** — Structure remains interpretable as systems evolve.
2. **Enforce structural constraints** — Invariants are explicit and violations are surfaced.
3. **Preserve traceability of change** — Every state transition is registered with deterministic ordering.

These claims are testable and falsifiable.

---

## What Registrum Does NOT Claim

Registrum makes no claims that:

- Structure is "correct"
- Preserved states are meaningful
- Constrained systems perform better
- Registrum improves learning, accuracy, or outcomes
- Legibility implies value
- Registration implies endorsement

Registrum is agnostic about semantics.
It preserves structure without asserting that structure matters.

## Falsifiability

Registrum can fail. The following conditions would falsify its claims:

1. **Invariants are violated silently** — A constraint is broken without surfacing the violation.
2. **Determinism breaks** — The same inputs produce different registration outcomes.
3. **Illegible states are allowed through** — A state transition passes registration despite violating legibility constraints.
4. **Entropy collapses structure despite constraints** — Structure becomes uninterpretable even when constraints are satisfied.

If any of these conditions occur, Registrum has failed its stated purpose.

## What This Means

Registrum is scientifically honest because:

- Its claims are bounded
- Its non-claims are explicit
- Its failure conditions are defined
- It does not assert meaning, only structure

This document exists to prevent Registrum from becoming unfalsifiable.
