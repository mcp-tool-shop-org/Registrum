# Migration Decision Criteria

## Purpose

This document defines the conditions under which the registry-based invariant system may replace the legacy TypeScript invariant system.

**This decision is evidence-based, not aesthetic.**

## Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Legacy system** | `src/invariants.ts` — TypeScript predicate functions |
| **Registry system** | `invariants/registry.json` + DSL + loader + evaluator |
| **Parity** | Identical structural outcomes for the same inputs |
| **Divergence** | Any difference in accept/reject/halt outcomes or invariant IDs |

## Migration Preconditions (All Required)

The registry system may replace the legacy system **only if** all conditions below are met.

### 1. Behavioral Parity

- [x] All legacy invariants are represented in the registry
- [x] Parity tests exist for every invariant
- [x] No undocumented divergence exists
- [x] Parity tests pass for all 11 invariants across 3 groups:
  - Identity (3 invariants)
  - Lineage (4 invariants)
  - Ordering (4 invariants)

### 2. Explicit Divergence Resolution

If divergence exists, **one** of the following must be true:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Legacy system is underspecified | Documentation is updated to clarify intent |
| Registry DSL needs extension | DSL extended without violating safety constraints |
| Fundamental incompatibility | Migration is postponed or aborted |

**Silent divergence is forbidden.**

Any divergence must be:
1. Documented in tests with explicit comments
2. Reviewed and approved
3. Justified with rationale

### 3. Auditability Advantage

The registry system must demonstrably provide:

- [x] **Independent inspectability**: Registry can be read/validated without executing code
- [x] **Static rejection of unsafe predicates**: DSL validator rejects semantic access patterns
- [x] **No regression in test coverage**: All existing invariant tests continue to pass

If these advantages are not realized, migration is unjustified.

### 4. No Semantic Expansion

The registry system must **not**:

- Introduce optimization logic
- Introduce heuristics
- Introduce evaluation or preference mechanisms
- Increase expressiveness beyond declared invariants
- Access semantic content (state.data, state.content, state.embedding)

The DSL is intentionally limited. This is a feature, not a bug.

## Decision Outcomes

| Condition | Outcome | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Full parity achieved | **PROCEED** | Registry becomes default implementation |
| Minor gaps exist | **FIX** | Extend DSL or clarify spec, repeat parity tests |
| Fundamental mismatch | **ABORT** | Document limits, retain legacy system |

## Authority

Migration approval requires:

1. ✅ Passing parity test suite (`tests/parity/*.test.ts`)
2. ✅ Review of documented divergences (none at current time)
3. ✅ Explicit versioned decision

**No silent cutover is permitted.**

## Current Status

### Parity Test Results

```
Test Files: 7 passed
Tests:      124 passed
```

### Test Structure

```
tests/
├── invariants.test.ts              # 27 constitutional tests (legacy)
├── registry.test.ts                # 25 registry system tests
└── parity/
    ├── parity.helpers.ts           # Normalization utilities
    ├── identity.parity.test.ts     # 13 identity invariant parity tests
    ├── lineage.parity.test.ts      # 14 lineage invariant parity tests
    ├── ordering.parity.test.ts     # 12 ordering invariant parity tests
    ├── metadata.parity.test.ts     # 19 metadata parity tests
    └── registry-mode.parity.test.ts # 14 registry mode tests (C.5)
```

### Invariant Coverage

| Group | Invariants | Parity Status |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| Identity | 3 | ✅ PARITY |
| Lineage | 4 | ✅ PARITY |
| Ordering | 4 | ✅ PARITY |
| **Total** | **11** | **✅ FULL PARITY** |

### Documented Divergence

**None.** Both systems produce identical structural judgments for all tested inputs.

### Auditability Checklist

- [x] Registry is machine-readable JSON
- [x] DSL expressions are parsed and statically validated
- [x] Semantic access patterns are rejected at load time
- [x] Predicate evaluation is pure (no side effects)
- [x] No optimization or heuristic logic

## Phase C Status

Phase C is **COMPLETE**. The StructuralRegistrar now supports:

- [x] C.1: Root State Registration
- [x] C.2: State Identity Tracking
- [x] C.3: Lineage Storage & Querying
- [x] C.4: Deterministic Ordering Engine
- [x] C.5: Registry System Cut-In (Behind Flag)

### Registry Mode

The `StructuralRegistrar` now accepts a `mode` option:

```typescript
// Legacy mode (default) — uses TypeScript predicates
const legacy = new StructuralRegistrar();
const legacy = new StructuralRegistrar({ mode: "legacy" });

// Registry mode — uses compiled registry DSL
const registry = new StructuralRegistrar({
  mode: "registry",
  compiledRegistry: loadInvariantRegistry(rawJson),
});
```

**Default remains "legacy".** Registry mode is opt-in only.

## Recommendation

**PHASE C COMPLETE** — Ready for Phase D or final documentation lock.

The unified StructuralRegistrar with mode support provides:
1. Full backward compatibility (legacy mode is default)
2. Full forward compatibility (registry mode opt-in)
3. No silent cutover (explicit mode selection required)
4. Evidence-based migration path (124 passing tests)

## Cutover Checklist (Phase D)

Before making registry mode the default:

- [ ] Final parity test run
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off
- [ ] Version bump to 1.0.0
- [ ] Legacy mode marked deprecated (not removed)
- [ ] Migration documented in CHANGELOG
