# Governance Philosophy

Registrum is governed under a constitutional model.

Governance exists to protect:
- structural guarantees
- determinism
- replayability
- scientific integrity

Governance does not exist to:
- maximize feature velocity
- optimize user experience
- resolve disagreements by consensus
- reinterpret past decisions

The primary obligation of governance is to preserve legibility under entropy.

Behavioral guarantees take precedence over convenience, adoption, and extensibility.

## Constitutional Principle

> Behavioral guarantees are more important than feature velocity.

This is not a preference. It is a constraint.

Changes that threaten provable guarantees are rejected by default, regardless of their benefits. The burden of proof lies with the proposer, not the system.

## What Governance Protects

1. **Invariants** — The 11 structural rules that define valid transitions
2. **Determinism** — Same inputs produce same outputs, always
3. **Replayability** — Historical decisions can be re-executed with identical results
4. **Fail-closed behavior** — Invalid state cannot be partially recovered
5. **Auditability** — Structural judgments are reproducible after the fact

These are not features. They are the system's identity.

## What Governance Prevents

1. **Semantic creep** — Gradual, undocumented changes to meaning
2. **Evidence-free changes** — Modifications without parity proof
3. **Consensus override** — Popularity does not outweigh correctness
4. **Retroactive reinterpretation** — Past decisions remain fixed

---

## Governance Is Not

- A review process (that is contributor responsibility)
- A feature gate (non-governed changes proceed normally)
- A veto mechanism (it is an evidence requirement)
- Optional (governed changes without process are invalid)
